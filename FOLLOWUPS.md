## Rung 1.4 close (2026-05-15)

### Critical — deferred to Rung 1.5 eval

- [ ] **RQ-Listener-1: Model A preservation across CSS .meta overwrite**.
  `test_agent_enrichment_survives_body_rewrite` xfailed with diagnosis. Three mitigation paths analyzed in `docs/plans/2026-05-15-rq-listener-1-mitigation-design.md`.
  Decision criterion: if Rung 1.5 eval surfaces real agent-extension use cases (agents PATCHing `.meta` outside the governed set), pick option (B) `.meta.agent` sidecar — clean semantics, revises D81 with successor D82. If eval shows agents never extend, reframe the xfail as documentation.

### Small — fix when needed

- [ ] **WIKI_NS central constant**.
  `urn:example:wiki#` placeholder embedded in 18 files across shapes, listener code, pod-templates, fixtures, tests. Before namespace minting (blocked by RQ-Harness-1), extract to a shared constant so the eventual mint touches one file. Currently sed-replaceable.

- [ ] **`foaf:affiliation` frontmatter mapping**.
  PersonShape allows `foaf:affiliation`, `governedPredicates` includes it, but `frontmatterProjection.ts` has no `affiliation:` key. Agents can't set affiliation via body+frontmatter today. Two-line fix when an eval task needs affiliation traversal.

### Documented elsewhere (cross-references)

- **RQ-Pod-4** — Comunica `.meta` traversal gap, workaround documented at `docs/plans/2026-05-15-rq-pod-4-workaround-notes.md`. Decision point: Rung 1.5+ if explicit-source pattern becomes a bottleneck.
- **K2 (triple-hyphen slugs)** — `slug()` doesn't collapse consecutive hyphens. Accepted for v1 in `decisions-index.md`; refinement is post-spike.
- **K3 (`.author` → `dct:contributor`)** — class-hint dispatch can't differentiate concept-contributor from source-creator. Distinct `.creator` class hint is a Rung 1.5+ option.
- **Task 42 (context-driven listener dispatch)** — `wikilinkProjection.ts` uses hardcoded class-hint table instead of reading `/meta/context.jsonld` at runtime. Functionally equivalent; deferred to Rung 1.5 cleanup per D79.

## Pre-existing (earlier rungs)

- **RQ-Harness-1** — fabric namespace minting at `https://cogitarelink.org/ns/fabric#` — blocks all `fabric:*` predicates past prototype.
- **RQ-Eval-1/2/3** — task suite design, sub-agent config, GEPA convergence (Rung 1.5 work).
- **RQ-Memento-1/2**, **RQ-Federation-1** — see `decisions-index.md`.
